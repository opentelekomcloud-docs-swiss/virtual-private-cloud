Overview
========

Welcome to *Virtual Private Cloud API Reference*. A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) enables you to provision logically isolated, configurable, and manageable virtual networks for Elastic Cloud Servers (ECSs), improving the security of cloud resources and simplifying network deployment.

This document describes how to use application programming interfaces (APIs) to perform operations on VPCs, such as creating, querying, deleting, and updating a VPC. For details about all supported operations, see :ref:`API Overview <en-us_topic_0173364207>`.

If you plan to access VPCs through an API, ensure that you are familiar with VPC concepts. For details, see "Service Overview" in *Virtual Private Cloud User Guide*.
