What Is a Quota?
================


What Is a Quota?
----------------

A quota limits the quantity of a resource available to users, thereby preventing spikes in the usage of the resource. For example, a VPC quota limits the number of VPCs that can be created.

You can also request for an increased quota if your existing quota cannot meet your service requirements.
