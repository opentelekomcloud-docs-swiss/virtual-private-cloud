How Many VPC Peering Connections Can I Create in an Account?
============================================================

If you use a VPC peering connection to connect VPCs in the same region, you can log in to the management console to view your VPC peering connection quota. For details, see :ref:`What Is a Quota? <vpc_faq_0051>`

-  Number of VPC peering connections that you can create in each region between VPCs in the same account: subject to the actual quota

-  Number of VPC peering connections that you can create in each region between VPCs in different accounts: Accepted VPC peering connections use the quotas of both accounts. To-be-accepted VPC peering connections only use the quotas of accounts that request the connections.

   An account can create VPC peering connections with different accounts if the account has enough quota.
