Direct Connect
==============

Direct Connect allows you to establish a dedicated network connection between your data center and the cloud platform. With Direct Connect, you can establish a private connection between the cloud platform and your data center, office, or collocation environment, which can reduce your network latency and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections.

For more information about Direct Connect, see the `Direct Connect User Guide <https://docs.sc.otc.t-systems.com/usermanual/dc/en-us_topic_0032053183.html>`__.
